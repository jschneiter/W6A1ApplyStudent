			<p>Building good Credit doesn't take much work, only self control and a bit of money management skills. In this day and age when young adults are bombarded with credit card offers and high spending limits right off the bat, it's no wonder that people fall into debt so easily. It can be intoxicating almost to someone who doesn't know how to avoid the most common pitfalls involving credit. In the end, the best you can do for yourself is to edcuate yourself on how to manage your money wisely, learning the differences between wants and needs and knowing how to tell yourself no, and getting some useful tips. Never borrowing more than 30% of your total credit, for example, is a great way to build your credit score. Pay your credit card balance in full. Only borrow what you can afford. Making your payments on time. Carrying a balance won't hurt your credit limit, as long as you aren't late on your payments and pay more than the minimum cost each month, following these rules, and keeping it below 30% of your total credit, are great ways to keep your credit score secure and even to build it up over time. More things you can do include keeping a limit on your open credit accounts, only have what you need, and keep them for as long as you can. Aged credit accounts with good standing are excellent for your scores.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Always make sure to never borrow more than you can afford, always stay within 30% of your total credit limit.</li>
				<li>Make your payments on time, and if you can't pay them in full each month, then do make sure to pay over the minimum payment each month.</li>
				<li>Keep your total number of credit accounts low, only use what you actually need. And at the same time, let those accounts age. An old, well maintained credit account is great history for you.</li>
